Task Two: Data analytics platform

# The task 
Acme Clothing are a retailer selling t-shirts. They are expanding and need a new data analytics
platform. They would like it to report on their existing data, and provide a real-time dashboard with
key business metrics. The essential metrics need to be calculated per day, week and calendar month
and compare to last period. These include:

* Turnover
* Profit
* Top 10 biggest selling products (irrespective of variant)
* Current unfulfilled order count
* Minimum, maximum and average time taken to fulfil orders

Your task is to implement the analytics platform. The minimal set of requirements that you must
reach is:

* Implement the basic functionality that is outlined above.
* Data is structured appropriately and held in memory. There is no need to connect to an external database. You may use a mocking framework to act as a proxy of a database or (better)	design your own in-memory structure.
* Any output is displayed to a terminal.
* You should generate input from unit tests or through similar automation.
* A set of sample data is loaded automatically when the program starts.

More complex functionality that builds on the minimal set includes:

* A GUI dashboard which may be implemented as a Web page or as a desktop application.
* Data stored in an external database.
* Changes made to the data at run-time are reflected accurately on the dashboard.
* Users can generate ad-hoc queries.
* Up to three of your own extensions
